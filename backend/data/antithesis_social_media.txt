Con Article: Social Media as a Source of Division
Yet the very platforms that promise connection often breed division. Social media thrives on algorithms that amplify outrage, not understanding. What gains traction is rarely truth, but what provokes the strongest reaction. The result: polarization, misinformation, and a culture of perpetual distraction.

Instead of elevating thoughtful voices, these platforms often reward sensationalism and half-truths. Echo chambers reinforce biases, while anonymity fuels harassment and hate. The addictive design — endless scrolling, likes, and dopamine hits — turns users into products, their attention sold to advertisers.

Studies link heavy social media use to increased anxiety, depression, and loneliness. Ironically, the tool meant to connect us often leaves people more isolated. Far from being a modern agora, social media risks becoming a digital colosseum — where attention is the prize, and nuance is the casualty.

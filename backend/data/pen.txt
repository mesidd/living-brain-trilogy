The Pen: Artificial
The pen is humanity’s oldest companion in preserving thought. With each stroke, it transforms fleeting ideas into lasting records. Whether drafting a treaty, writing poetry, or jotting down a grocery list, the pen holds a quiet power: it makes the intangible visible.
More than just a writing tool, the pen is deeply personal. Its ink carries individuality — no two handwritings are alike. Unlike keyboards, which flatten expression, the pen reflects emotion in its curves and pressure. In classrooms, journals, and sketchbooks, it remains a timeless reminder that human creativity often begins with a simple line on paper.

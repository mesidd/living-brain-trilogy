Have you ever noticed whenever we make a plan, we always try to keep it perfect ?

Whether it’s our career path, a fitness routine, writing codes, building projects, or personal work, we waste a lot of time on non-essential details to make it flawless.

This is what we call premature optimisation - the act of trying to perfect something too early.

If you remember the principle Regression Towards The Mean (RTTM), it says things often revert towards the mean. But we plan always keeping the extreme results in mind.

Here is an example of Instagram’s early infrastructure issues:

Before the launch of Instagram, the team focused heavily on perfecting photo filters and user experience, spending a lot of time on it.

When Instagram launched, its user base grew exponentially. But the backend couldn't scale quickly, unable to handle, caused frequent crashes of the app.

As a result, the team had to rebuild their backend infrastructure, which took significant time and effort.

That does not mean we should stop planning, but there should be a limit on optimisation.

We should start with something simple, evolve over time, and use real-world experiences, not theoretical expectations.

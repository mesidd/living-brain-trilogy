Apple: Natural
The apple is a fruit of the Malus domestica tree, belonging to the rose family. It develops from the flowerâ€™s ovary, ripening into a fleshy structure that protects its seeds. Its skin, ranging from green to red, shields the inner flesh, while its crisp texture comes from water-filled cells that burst when bitten.
Nutritionally, the apple provides fiber, natural sugars, and vitamin C, making it both refreshing and sustaining. Biologically, its sweetness is an evolutionary strategy: by attracting animals and humans, the apple ensures its seeds are spread to new soil, continuing the life cycle of the tree.
